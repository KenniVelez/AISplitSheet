# AISplitSheet

AISplitSheet is a software tool that uses artificial intelligence to automatically generate split sheets for music collaborations. Split sheets are legal documents that outline the ownership and distribution of revenue for a musical work that is created by multiple collaborators.

AISplitSheet simplifies the process of creating a split sheet by analyzing the audio files of a musical work and automatically identifying the contributions of each collaborator. The software then generates a split sheet that accurately reflects the ownership and distribution of revenue for the work.
